 * This method allows you to execute write operations inside EM Trustless, Serverless Functions.
 * By requesting to the module `em-backend`, it creates a write operation which will be automatically processed.
 * Note that the result returned by this function is optimistic as the final processing for the global state of the function
 * Might take a few more seconds in order for it to be available and propagated.
 *
 *
 * @param functionId The function ID (An Arweave valid TX id) to be processed
 * @param writeOps A single operation or an array of operations to be sent. Note a limit of 499 write operations are enforced.
 * @param emToken EM Token to authenticate request
